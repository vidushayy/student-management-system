# 🎓 Student Management System – My First Python Project!

Hey there! 👋  
This is my very first project in Python — a simple **Student Management System** that runs in the terminal. It helped me practice **object-oriented programming**, and it was a fun way to bring coding concepts to life.

---

## 🧠 What It Can Do

With this program, you can:

- ➕ Add a new student
- 🔍 View all students or search for one
- 📝 Update a student’s details
- ❌ Delete a student
- 📋 Navigate everything through a simple menu

It’s all text-based, and it works right from the command line. No fancy GUI (yet 😅)!

---

## 🛠 Built With

- Python 3.x
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Just a lot of `print()` and `input()` statements 😊

---

## 🏁 How To Run It

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system:
   ```bash
   python --version
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-management-system.git
cd student-management-system
python project.py
